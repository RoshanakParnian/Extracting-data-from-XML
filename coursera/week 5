The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL , using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data, 
compute the sum of the numbers in the file and enter the sum and avg .
We provide two kinds of sample codes for testing  .
...
Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_1641435.xml (Sum ends with 45)
...
After that , It recieves all data and converts to 'int' to sum together and calculate average of these data .
It has used 2 ways to attain 'count' in this program that one of them is shown by # .
...

import urllib.request , urllib.parse , urllib.error
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
sum = 0
count = 0
url = input('ENTER-')
xmll = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
tree = ET.fromstring(xmll)
lst = tree.findall('comments/comment')
for item in lst :
    num = int(item.find('count').text)
    print('NUM : ' , num)
    sum = sum + num
    count = count + 1

#counts =len(lst)
#print('~~USER COUNT :' , counts)
print('~~COUNT :' , count)
print('~~SUM :' , sum)
print('~~AVG :' , sum / count)
